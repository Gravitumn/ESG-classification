Part of these were the final lot of frequencies remaining from the previously expired concession.,E,ADVANC
"In addition to the use of spectrum licenses, all three operators have entered into a business partnership agreement with state enterprises joining together to co-utilize the frequencies of which the state enterprises have the right to operate.",N,ADVANC

"In Thailand, the mobile phone user penetration rate was within the 130–140% range, reflecting a fairly saturated market in terms of number of users.",E,ADVANC
"These numbers have resulted in service provider competition for the retention of existing customers, as well as continual competition for customer share in the market.",E,ADVANC
"Meanwhile, price competition in the past year focused on offering unlimited data usage packages, particularly fixed-speed unlimited data packages, ranging from 1–6 Mbps, with these gaining greater popularity among customers due to the ability to use data without limit concerns.",E,ADVANC

"Attractive discounts on handset prices have remained a key strategy for operators in drawing customers looking to purchase handsets in conjunction with specific packages (bundles packages), especially in relation to postpaid customer campaigns.",E,ADVANC
"However, overall spending by mobile operators in marketing campaigns, including the aforementioned discounts, is likely to decrease from the previous year, with a focus instead on more area-based marketing, reflecting tighter control of campaign and cost effectiveness.",E,ADVANC
"Postpaid migration continues, driven by increased smartphone and social media usage In 2018, total market data usage rates continued to increase, with a customer data usage of over 10 data sub/month thanks to social media applications and the growth of the e-commerce market, along with smartphone usage rate growth to around 77%.",E,ADVANC
"All of these factors have helped to encourage customer need for constant internet connectivity, resulting in the continued trend of prepaid to postpaid migration throughout the past year, with the proportion of postpaid numbers per total numbers at 26% this year, compared to 22% in 2017, causing the for the entire industry to grow by approximately 2% from last year to Baht 240 during of this year.",E,ADVANC
"Fixed broadband market increases as fibre service demand grows Throughout the past year, the fixed broadband market has continued to see revenue growth at more than 10%, as the demand for internet connectivity in residential areas continues to increase.",E,ADVANC
"The overall market grew from 8.2 million connected households in 2017 to over 9.3 million in 2018, or 43% of households with fixed broadband connectivity.",E,ADVANC
"Service providers continue to focus on expanding fibre service coverage, along with seeking out new customers while still maintaining their existing customer base, by using more concentrated pricing strategies, such as issuing fibre packages of 10 Mbps at a starting price of Baht 250.",E,ADVANC
Incumbents have also tried to offer steep discounts to existing customers in the event of customers looking to cancel or change service providers.,G,ADVANC
"For these reasons, the industry in 2018 has decreased to approximately Baht 580.",E,ADVANC
"However, in order to meet the needs of households requiring internet usage for many family members or connections for multiple devices, service providers continue to offer high-speed fibre packages, such as 1 Gbps packages for the price of Baht 2,999.",E,ADVANC
"Additionally, service providers with other available services apart from high-speed internet continue to offer convergence packages, combining a variety of services into the same package, including high-speed internet, internet SIMs for mobile phones, and content.",E,ADVANC
"Such offers highlight the value of overall packages being greater than simply high-speed internet packages alone, and have more recently greatly increased in popularity with consumers.",E,ADVANC
Industry Trends in 2019 Mobile phone market continues to expand due to services and competition continues.,E,ADVANC
"Throughout 2019, it is expected that the mobile phone market will continue to expand due to usage for video content and social media.",E,ADVANC
"In addition, a gradual reduction of fixed-speed unlimited data packages is expected to help operator revenue to improve gradually.",E,ADVANC

"network quality, both in terms of coverage and speed, is still a key factor in customers’ service choices and decision-making process.",G,ADVANC
"In addition, brand image and various other privileges will be more important to competitiveness in areas where the network quality of operators is not very dissimilar.",E,ADVANC
"Current trends also show that operators are increasingly utilizing modern technology to learn about customer behaviors, helping them to provide better products and services for each customer.",G,ADVANC
"In terms of spectrum demand in order to provide more services, when considering spectrum allocation in the past year and the relatively low level of interest in bidding on said spectrums, it is expected that operators have retained sufficient frequencies to serve their customers for a certain period of time.",N,ADVANC
"Additionally, existing conditions and auction prices may not be sufficiently attractive or may not yet create enough additional value for business operations at this time.",E,ADVANC
"Not only that, but currently there are increased numbers of customers switching from usage, making it possible to allocate more frequencies between technologies.",E,ADVANC
"Therefore, demand for additional spectrum auctions for services may yet remain unclear in 2019.",E,ADVANC
"This also includes greater clarity with regard to frequency allocation, as appropriate frequency allocation will help encourage more effective investment in technology and enhance the country’s growth in a wide variety of businesses and industries.",E,ADVANC
"According to current standards, frequency bands that can be used to provide technology services consist of those below 1GHz (Low Band), such as 700MHz; those in the range between 1GHz and 6GHz (Mid Band), such as 2.6GHz and 3.4 – 3.8GHz; as well as frequency bands above 24GHz (High Band), such as 26-28GHz, etc.",E,ADVANC
"It is therefore expected that operators, in collaboration with their partners, will begin increased preparation of their networks to support technology.",N,ADVANC
"This includes, for example, plans for investment in Massive technology in some areas before going ahead with actual investment and commercial usage.",E,ADVANC
This would also allow service providers to contribute information to the in effective planning of spectrum allocation and usage in the country.,N,ADVANC
"Continued fibre service expansion, creating advantages with convergence services The fixed broadband market is expected to continue growing at a similar rate to the previous year, at about 10%, due to the demand for internet connectivity in the home and the ratio of households with fixed broadband that can still expand from current levels of about 43%.",E,ADVANC

"Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation Under 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer.",N,ADVANC
