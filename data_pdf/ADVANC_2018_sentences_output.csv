162,Part of these were the final lot of frequencies remaining from the previously expired concession.
163,"In addition to the use of spectrum licenses, all three operators have entered into a business partnership agreement with state enterprises joining together to co-utilize the frequencies of which the state enterprises have the right to operate."

167,"In Thailand, the mobile phone user penetration rate was within the 130–140% range, reflecting a fairly saturated market in terms of number of users."

175,"Fixed broadband market increases as fibre service demand grows Throughout the past year, the fixed broadband market has continued to see revenue growth at more than 10%, as the demand for internet connectivity in residential areas continues to increase."
176,"The overall market grew from 8.2 million connected households in 2017 to over 9.3 million in 2018, or 43% of households with fixed broadband connectivity."
177,"Service providers continue to focus on expanding fibre service coverage, along with seeking out new customers while still maintaining their existing customer base, by using more concentrated pricing strategies, such as issuing fibre packages of 10 Mbps at a starting price of Baht 250."
178,Incumbents have also tried to offer steep discounts to existing customers in the event of customers looking to cancel or change service providers.
179,"For these reasons, the industry in 2018 has decreased to approximately Baht 580."
180,"However, in order to meet the needs of households requiring internet usage for many family members or connections for multiple devices, service providers continue to offer high-speed fibre packages, such as 1 Gbps packages for the price of Baht 2,999."
181,"Additionally, service providers with other available services apart from high-speed internet continue to offer convergence packages, combining a variety of services into the same package, including high-speed internet, internet SIMs for mobile phones, and content."

189,"Current trends also show that operators are increasingly utilizing modern technology to learn about customer behaviors, helping them to provide better products and services for each customer."
190,"In terms of spectrum demand in order to provide more services, when considering spectrum allocation in the past year and the relatively low level of interest in bidding on said spectrums, it is expected that operators have retained sufficient frequencies to serve their customers for a certain period of time."
191,"Additionally, existing conditions and auction prices may not be sufficiently attractive or may not yet create enough additional value for business operations at this time."
192,"Not only that, but currently there are increased numbers of customers switching from usage, making it possible to allocate more frequencies between technologies."
193,"Therefore, demand for additional spectrum auctions for services may yet remain unclear in 2019."
194,"This also includes greater clarity with regard to frequency allocation, as appropriate frequency allocation will help encourage more effective investment in technology and enhance the country’s growth in a wide variety of businesses and industries."
195,"According to current standards, frequency bands that can be used to provide technology services consist of those below 1GHz (Low Band), such as 700MHz; those in the range between 1GHz and 6GHz (Mid Band), such as 2.6GHz and 3.4 – 3.8GHz; as well as frequency bands above 24GHz (High Band), such as 26-28GHz, etc."
196,"It is therefore expected that operators, in collaboration with their partners, will begin increased preparation of their networks to support technology."
197,"This includes, for example, plans for investment in Massive technology in some areas before going ahead with actual investment and commercial usage."
198,This would also allow service providers to contribute information to the in effective planning of spectrum allocation and usage in the country.
199,"Continued fibre service expansion, creating advantages with convergence services The fixed broadband market is expected to continue growing at a similar rate to the previous year, at about 10%, due to the demand for internet connectivity in the home and the ratio of households with fixed broadband that can still expand from current levels of about 43%."

1052,2) Thai Financial Reporting Standards announced in the Royal Gazette but not yet effective 2.
1053,15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers.
1054,"It will supersede the following revenue Standards and Interpretations upon its effective date: Thai Accounting Standard No.11 “Construction Contracts” , Thai Accounting Standard No.18 “Revenue”, Thai Accounting Standard Interpretation No.31 “Revenue-Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services”, Thai Financial Reporting Standard Interpretation No.13 “Customer Loyalty Programmes, Thai Financial Reporting Standard Interpretation No.15 “Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate” and Thai Financial Reporting Standard Interpretation No.18 “Transfers of Assets from Customers”."
1055,"15 requires retrospective method in accordance with Thai Accounting Standard No.8 “Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors” or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying this Standard as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period."
1056,The core principle of 15 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects to consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
1057,"Specifically, the Standard introduces a 5-step approach to revenue recognition: Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract."
1058,"Step 3: Determine the transaction price Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract Step 5: Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation Under 15, an entity recognizes revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i.e., when ‘control’ of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to the customer."
1059,"It applies to the classification of financial instruments, from the perspective of the issuer, into financial assets, financial liabilities and equity instruments; the classification of related interest, dividends, losses and gains; the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities should be offset."
1060,"31, 2018 6 This accounting standard shall be applied retrospectively for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020."

1062,The entity shall disclose that fact.
1063,"Thai Financial Reporting Standard No.7 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” This financial reporting standard requires entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for the entity’s financial position and performance and the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the reporting period and at the end of the reporting period, and how the entity manages those risks."
1064,"If an entity initially applies this financial reporting standard, it needs not present comparative information for the disclosures about the nature and extent of risks arising from the financial instruments."
1065,"Thai Financial Reporting Standard No.9 “Financial Instruments” The financial reporting standard establishes principles for the financial reporting of financial assets and financial liabilities that will present relevant and useful information to users of financial statements for their assessment of the amounts, timing and uncertainty of an entity’s future cash flows."
1066,"This financial reporting standard includes 3 requirements for the recognition and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting."
1067,All recognized financial assets that are within the scope of 9 are required to be subsequently measured at amortized cost or fair value.
1068,"Specifically, debt investments that are held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash flows, and that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principle and interest on the principle outstanding are generally measured at amortized cost at the end of subsequent accounting periods."
1069,"Debt instruments that are held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, and that have contractual terms that give rise on specific dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principle and interest on the principal amount outstanding, are generally measured at"
1070,All other debt investments and equity investments are measured at their fair value at the end of subsequent accounting periods.
1071,"In addition, under 9, entities may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in the fair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading nor contingent consideration recognized by an acquirer in a business combination) in other comprehensive income, with only dividend income generally recognized in profit or loss."
1072,"154 Annual Report 2018 9 requires that the amount of change in fair value of a financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability is presented in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of such changes in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss."
1073,Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit or loss.
1074,"In relation to the impairment of financial assets, 9 requires an expected credit loss model."
1075,The expected credit loss model requires an entity to account for expected credit loss and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect changes in credit risk since initial recognition.
1076,"In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event to have occurred before credit losses are recognized."
1077,"9 have been introduced to the types of transactions eligible for hedge accounting, specifically broadening the types of instruments that qualify for hedging instruments and the types of risk components of non-financial items that are eligible for hedge accounting."
1078,"In addition, the effectiveness test has been overhauled with the principle of an ‘economic relationship’."
1079,Disclosure requirements about an entity’s risk management activities have also been introduced.
1080,"An entity can elect to apply this Standard retrospectively, in accordance with Thai Accounting Standard No.8 (Revised 201"

1083,The entity shall disclose that fact.

1085,This Interpretation requires prospective method for such application.
1086,Thai Financial Reporting Standard Interpretations No.19 “Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments” This Interpretation addresses the circumstance that an entity issues equity instruments to a creditor of the entity to extinguish all or part of the financial liability.

1099,The standard requires companies to apportion revenue earned from contracts to performance obligations based on a five-step model on a relative standalone selling price basis.

1101,The adoption of 15 will have the following key effects:
1102,Contract asset in the statement of financial position represents the difference between the revenue recognized and the upfront cash consideration received from customers.
1103,"157 Advanced Info Service Public Company Limited 31, 2018 10 3."

1112,"Consideration transferred includes the fair values of the assets transferred, liabilities incurred by the Group and the Company to the previous owners of the acquiree, and equity interests issued by the Group and the Company."
1113,Consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration and share-based payment awards of the acquiree that are replaced mandatorily in the business combination.
1114,"If a business combination results in the termination of pre-existing relationships between the Group and the Company and the acquiree, then the lower of the termination amount, as contained in the agreement, and the value of the off-market element is deducted from the consideration transferred and recognized in other expenses."
1115,"contingent liability of the acquiree is assumed in a business combination only if such a liability represents a present obligation and arises from a past event, and its fair value can be measured reliably."
1116,The Group and the Company measure any non-controlling interest at its proportionate interest in the identifiable net assets of the acquiree.
1117,"Transaction costs that the Group and the Company incur in connection with a business combination such as legal fees, other professional and consulting fees are expensed as incurred."
1118,Acquisitions from entities under common control Business combinations of entities or businesses under common control are accounted for using a method similar to the pooling of interest method and in accordance with the Guideline issued in 2009 by the Federation of Accounting Professions.

1123,Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the statement of profit or loss and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.
1124,Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value when control is lost.
1125,Interests in equity - accounted investees The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in an associate and joint ventures.
1126,The Company’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in subsidiaries.

1130,"Interests in an associate, subsidiaries and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method."
1131,"They are recognized initially at cost, which includes transaction costs."
1132,"Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated and separate financial statements include the Group’s and the Company’s share of profit or loss of equity-accounted investees in the profit or loss and other comprehensive income, until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases."
1133,"Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income or expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements."
1134,Unrealized gains arising from transactions with equity-accounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee.
